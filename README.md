## MDDN 242 Project 1: Time-based Media  

10/03/2024
My idea is inspired by the flight boards seen in airports, I plan on having a middle strip in the desig with an aeroplane traveling with the hours, flying from sunrise to sunset with an ombre that changes with the hour, and the plane traveling from hours 1-12, the alarm will feature a bird hitting the windshield of the plane and being wiped off.

I decided to spend today trying to get the lerp colour gradient to work in conjunction with time. First I had to learn how to make a solid gradient, for which I used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPgscmgxcH0 to learn from, then I attempted to evolve it from their to include for if-else requests around the changes in time. To start of with I decided to work in seconds so that I could see the changes more clearly

Today I worked further on the gradient, I also added in the sqaures for the number to sit on.
This time with the gradient I worked on getting it to change with the hour, and accross the screen using what was taught in class.
I added in a little plane, that flys accross the screen from 6am-6pm, on the hour it moves one step.

Today I worked on little clouds that move with the seconds, I haven't figured out how to get them to cleanly loop as the minute ends.

16/03/2024
Today I fixed up the clouds and made sure the loop completed, I'll later work on the Madea clock.

I opened the code, looked at it, tried something with the gradient and then gave up.
Madea clock not started.

18/03/2024
I did not work on the Madea clock.
Today met with Pheobe who fixed issues with gradients and showed how to make code smoooooooth.
Worked on cloud smoooooothness, and plane smoooooothness. 
Then worked further on gradient, which Sunrise, and Sunset broke, but both Twilight, and PreSet, work fine. Tried to fix this with changes to background colour, which did not help, changes to the if statement that runs this, did not help, running the code through chat gpt, did not help, and double checking the if variables are valid by running through different background colours, they are.

Left to do
- Alarm (Swarm of Birds take over the screen for 10 seconds, time left is diplayed on new flippy clock)
- Madea
- Gradient

Optionial Additions to do
- Make Clocks Flip

Today I worked on the Madea clock, based off of Clock 8, I struggled to get the clock to tick back into it's starting positon because I used seconds.

Today in studio Pheobe helped me fix the gradient issue, which was in the original mapping. I then made my alarm, scrapping the original idea of birds after having issues of animating due to the functions, instead swapping for the plane exploding in the sky and the background turns into a red gradient, whilst the timer is ticking down the clouds jump up and down.
The only downside of this new design is that if the plane is off the screen there is not effect aside from the colour of the sky changing.
