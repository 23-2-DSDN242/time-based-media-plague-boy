My idea is inspired by the flight boards seen in airports, I plan on having a middle strip in the desig with an aeroplane traveling with the hours, flying from sunrise to sunset with an ombre that changes with the hour, and the plane traveling from hours 1-12, the alarm will feature a bird hitting the windshield of the plane and being wiped off.

I decided to spend today trying to get the lerp colour gradient to work in conjunction with time. First I had to learn how to make a solid gradient, for which I used https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPgscmgxcH0 to learn from, then I attempted to evolve it from their to include for if-else requests around the changes in time. To start of with I decided to work in seconds so that I could see the changes more clearly
